# Epilepsy Patient Fall Detection System

## Overview
The Epilepsy Patient Fall Detection System is designed to monitor patients with epilepsy for any potential falls during seizures. This system aims to provide timely alerts to nearby individuals and notify relatives or caregivers via mobile notifications. By leveraging data science techniques, we can analyze various parameters related to the patient's movement, environmental conditions, and seizure activity to accurately detect falls and provide an immediate response.

## Features
- **Real-Time Fall Detection**: The system continuously monitors the patient using sensors and detects sudden movements or falls.
- **Sound Alert for Immediate Attention**: When a fall is detected, a loud sound is triggered to alert nearby people, ensuring immediate help can be provided.
- **Mobile Notifications**: Relatives or caregivers receive instant notifications on their mobile devices, keeping them informed of the patient's condition and need for assistance.
- **Data Science for Fall Analysis**: The system uses advanced data analysis techniques to process and analyze various parameters like motion, time, location, and environmental factors that influence falls during seizures.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: By collecting data over time, the system provides valuable insights into the patient's fall patterns, helping caregivers make informed decisions about their care.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The system utilizes predictive models to forecast the likelihood of future falls based on historical data, enabling proactive monitoring.

## Data Analysis Approach
We utilize a combination of machine learning and statistical techniques to analyze data from sensors (such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and heart rate monitors). This allows for:
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract key features from raw sensor data to identify fall patterns.
- **Fall Detection Algorithm**: Implement algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to classify fall events accurately.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal patient behaviors or falls that deviate from normal patterns, based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Provide graphical representations of fall data, trends, and patterns over time for easier interpretation by caregivers and doctors.

## Technologies Used
- **Sensors**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate sensors to monitor patient movements.
- **Data Science Libraries**: Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Mobile Notifications**: Integration with mobile platforms for real-time notifications (e.g., Firebase for Android/iOS).
- **Cloud Services**: Store and process patient data using cloud platforms for scalability and accessibility.
- **IoT**: Real-time data collection from wearable devices and environmental sensors.
